        links this recent activity with previous isolated public reporting on similar

        linked by others to the FIN7 threat actor group, our research suggests the
        activity is in fact espionage related and unlikely to be FIN7 related.\n\nThe
        MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However,
        we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including
        targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the
        use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we call \u201cPOWERSTATS\u201d.
